# CS 4120/6120 Final Project: Salary Prediction Models

## Instructions to run code properly

1. Run `data_cleaning.ipynb` which cleans data and writes to `cleaned.csv`
2. Run `linear_regression_model.ipynb` which runs LR models, and also downsamples, creating `downsampled_df.csv`
3. Run `svm_model.ipynb` and `nn_model.ipybn` in no specific order
4. If you want to test custom job descriptions, paste into `job_desc.txt` and run `user_test.ipynb`
