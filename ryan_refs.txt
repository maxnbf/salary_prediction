ideas for final stuff:
    Ascertain what our models found to be the most important terms

Limitations:
    - One imagines that were this model deployed, it would need constant retraining to reflect current market conditions

Conclusions:
    - Job descriptions are maybe not the best predictor of salary, even if human read, since
    - 

Future work:
    Direct feature engineering (industry, location, job title keyword, etc..)
    Use models that try to capture semantic meaning
    Word Embeddings
