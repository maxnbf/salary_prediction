# CS 4120/6120 Final Project: Salary Prediction Models

## Discrete Work 
- Create NB Model
- Create LR Model
  - Use coefficients from LR to find a subset of important features, and retrain model and train other models using reduced set of features
- Create SVM Model
   - Research different parameters 
- Create NN Models
  - Create FFN
    - Abstracted function where its easy to change number of layers, hidden units, activation functions
  - Create RNN
- Visualize and briefly discuss the results
